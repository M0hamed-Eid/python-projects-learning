# Python Projects for Learning

Welcome to the **Python Projects for Learning** repository! This repository is dedicated to building practical command-line applications in Python, progressing from beginner to intermediate levels. Each project here is designed to help you develop foundational Python skills and deepen your understanding through hands-on practice.

## Project Ideas

Here are some suggested projects that gradually increase in complexity. Each project introduces essential programming concepts and problem-solving techniques. You can complete them in any order, but following the sequence will help you build skills progressively.

### 1. Calculator
Create a basic calculator to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project will give you practice with functions and control flow.

### 2. Number Guessing Game
Develop a number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it. Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. This project covers loops and conditional statements.

### 3. Unit Converter
Build a unit converter to convert between units (e.g., kilometers to miles, Celsius to Fahrenheit). It will strengthen your understanding of functions and handling user input.

### 4. Password Generator
Create a password generator that produces random, secure passwords based on user-defined criteria (length, inclusion of special characters, etc.). This project will introduce random number generation and string manipulation.

### 5. Word Counter
Build a program that counts the words, characters, and lines in a given text file. This project focuses on file I/O operations and string manipulation.

### 6. To-Do List
Develop a to-do list application where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. This project will help you practice working with lists and user input.

### 7. Simple Quiz
Design a quiz application with multiple-choice questions, providing feedback on user answers. Itâ€™s a great way to practice working with lists, conditionals, and user input.

### 8. Contact Book
Create a contact book application that allows users to add, view, and delete contacts. This project helps practice working with data structures like lists or dictionaries.
